# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Introduction

**Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** are computational models inspired by the way the human brain processes information. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons), which transmit information through connections (synapses). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a special class of ANNs designed to process data that has a grid-like topology, such as images. CNNs excel at recognizing patterns in visual data, making them particularly effective for image and video recognition tasks.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Neurons:** Nodes in the network that take input, process it, and pass output to the next layer.
2. **Convolution:** The process of applying a filter to input data to detect features like edges, textures, and shapes.
3. **Pooling:** Downsampling operation that reduces the spatial dimensions of the data, retaining essential features.
4. **Fully Connected Layers:** Layers that connect every neuron to every other neuron in the previous layer, helping make the final classification decision.

## 1. Basics of Convolutional Neural Networks

### 1.1 What is Convolution?

Convolution in the context of neural networks refers to the application of a filter (or kernel) to an input (such as an image) to detect specific patterns or features. It slides over the input matrix (image) and performs element-wise multiplication followed by summing the results. This operation extracts features like edges, corners, or textures.

Mathematically, convolution is expressed as:

\[
f(x, y) = (I * K)(x, y) = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1}\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} I(i, j)K(x - i, y - j)
\]

Where:
- \( I \) is the input image,
- \( K \) is the kernel/filter,
- \( * \) represents the convolution operation,
- \( m \) and \( n \) are the dimensions of the kernel.

### 1.2 CNN Architecture

A typical CNN consists of several types of layers:

- **Convolutional Layer:** Applies filters to the input data to extract features.
- **Activation Layer (ReLU):** Introduces non-linearity into the network by applying activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit).
- **Pooling Layer (Max/Avg Pooling):** Reduces the spatial dimensions of the data, making the network less computationally expensive.
- **Fully Connected Layer:** After feature extraction, this layer outputs the final classification result.

## 2. CNN in Detail

### 2.1 Convolutional Layer

The convolutional layer is the core building block of CNNs. It uses a set of filters that slide over the image and create feature maps. Each filter detects specific features like edges or textures.

#### Example:
Consider a simple 3x3 filter and a 5x5 input image:

```
Input Image:      Filter:
1  2  3  0  1    1  0  1
4  5  6  1  2    0  1  0
7  8  9  3  4    1  1  1
0  1  2  4  5
1  2  3  5  6
```

The filter will slide over the image, computing the dot product of the filter and the image segment it overlaps, resulting in a new feature map.

#### Code Example (Convolution Operation):
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import convolve2d

# Example input image and filter
input_image = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 0, 1],
                        [4, 5, 6, 1, 2],
                        [7, 8, 9, 3, 4],
                        [0, 1, 2, 4, 5],
                        [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]])

filter_kernel = np.array([[1, 0, 1],
                          [0, 1, 0],
                          [1, 1, 1]])

# Apply convolution
output = convolve2d(input_image, filter_kernel, mode='valid')
print(output)
```

---

### 2.2 Activation Layer (ReLU)

After the convolution operation, the next step is to introduce non-linearity into the network. This is usually achieved by using activation functions such as the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU).

ReLU is defined as:

\[
ReLU(x) = \max(0, x)
\]

This function helps the network learn more complex patterns by eliminating negative values.

#### Code Example (ReLU Activation):
```python
import numpy as np

# Input feature map
feature_map = np.array([[1, -2, 3], [-1, 4, -2], [2, -3, 1]])

# Apply ReLU activation
relu_output = np.maximum(0, feature_map)
print(relu_output)
```

---

### 2.3 Pooling Layer

Pooling is a down-sampling operation that reduces the spatial size of the feature maps. It helps in reducing the computational complexity and mitigating overfitting by retaining only the most essential features.

- **Max Pooling:** Takes the maximum value from each region.
- **Average Pooling:** Takes the average value from each region.

#### Code Example (Max Pooling):
```python
import numpy as np

# Example feature map
feature_map = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4],
                        [5, 6, 7, 8],
                        [9, 10, 11, 12],
                        [13, 14, 15, 16]])

# Perform 2x2 max pooling
pool_size = 2
stride = 2
pool_output = np.array([[np.max(feature_map[i:i+pool_size, j:j+pool_size]) 
                         for j in range(0, feature_map.shape[1], stride)] 
                         for i in range(0, feature_map.shape[0], stride)])

print(pool_output)
```

### 2.4 Fully Connected Layer

After the convolutional and pooling layers, the final fully connected (dense) layers make the decision about the classification or regression task. In this layer, every neuron is connected to every other neuron from the previous layer. This layer uses the features extracted by previous layers to make predictions.

## 3. Advanced CNN Architectures

### 3.1 LeNet-5

LeNet-5 is one of the earliest CNN architectures, developed for handwritten digit recognition (MNIST dataset). It consists of two convolutional layers followed by two fully connected layers.

### 3.2 AlexNet

AlexNet is a deeper and more complex architecture designed to win the 2012 ImageNet competition. It has five convolutional layers followed by three fully connected layers and uses ReLU activation and max pooling to improve performance.

### 3.3 VGGNet

VGGNet is characterized by using very small (3x3) convolutional filters stacked on top of each other. This design principle helps capture more detailed patterns while maintaining a manageable network depth.

### 3.4 ResNet

ResNet (Residual Networks) introduced the concept of **skip connections** or **residual connections**, allowing gradients to flow more easily during backpropagation, which helps in training very deep networks without the vanishing gradient problem.

## 4. Code Example: Building a CNN with Keras

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to create a CNN for image classification using Keras.

```python
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Create a Sequential model
model = Sequential()

# Convolutional Layer 1
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)))

# Max Pooling Layer 1
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))

# Convolutional Layer 2
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))

# Max Pooling Layer 2
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))

# Flattening the feature maps
model.add(Flatten())

# Fully Connected Layer
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))

# Output Layer (for binary classification)
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Model Summary
model.summary()
```
