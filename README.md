# Convolutional Neural Network

## Introduction

Neural Network is a method in AI that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain where we use interconnected nodes (neurons)  in a layered structure that resembles a human brain.

Convolutional literally means result of a function and the process of computing it.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network which is used primarily for image recognigition and processing, due to its ability to recognize patterns in images.

CNN is regularized type of feed-forward neural network that learns features by itself via filter optimization.
